Hi reviewer,

I have implemented assignment using lombok for getter/setter and mapstruct for converting entities to dto's 
(I even wrote 1 test to prove it ;)). 

Also to avoid tight coupling I implemented accountservice using interface. 
Swagger could be found here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#.

Thank you!

Cheers,
Yulia
